            The early roman calendar as claimed to come from Romulus,
            but in actuality came from the Etruscans.
            It descended from calendars that tracked the lunar cycle,
            29.5 day per month (alternating 29 and 30),
            but the days were made longer for unclear reasons.
            The intercalary was meant to realign to the lunar and solar cycles,
            but it was 10 days too short, which eventually put summer in winter.

            50 years after Rome was founded, King Pompilius Numa attempted to realign the year with the calendar,
            by making the months add up to a year. However, the year only added up to 355 days,
            so periodically an intercalary period was needed to realign the calendar.
            The pontiff of the roman faith decided when and how long an intercalary should be,
            which eventually got abused to keep allies in office longer.
            This variability meant that in the provinces the exact date was often not known.

            The abuse by the pontiffs led Julius Caesar didn't like this system due to its vagueness,
            so he changed it to one we recognize now, except there was a leap year every 4 years,
            which caused the calendar to drift against the solar year.
            After caesar's death Mark Antony renamed Quintilis to Iulius to honor him.
            Later Sextilis would be renamed to honor emperor Augustus.

            Pope Gregory's calendar introduced the leap year rule we now know:
            Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.<br>
            This calendar took a long time to be adopted by countries.
            As a consequence, <strong>historical dates don't always mean what you think they do</strong>.<br>
            This calendar drifts one day per 7700 years, meaning in 1.4 million years winter falls in summer.
            Herschel's calendar fixes it by making multiples of 4000 not be leap years,
            which drifts only one day per 30.000 years.

            Many cultures used weeks to track the phases of the moon,
            alternating 7 and 8 day weeks. The romans originally had an 8 day week,
            inherited from the Etruscans.
            However, for reasons which are not clear, the romans gradually
            moved to a 7 day week, with the days named according to the
            seven heavenly bodies visible with the naked eye.
            The germanic tribes didn't particularly care for those names,
            so they renamed most of them.

            Hours don't come from the romans but from the ancient egyptians.
            They divided the day into 10 hours and 2 twilight hours,
            then later the night hours were divided similarly.
            Also later (~200 BC) the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes would divide
            each hour into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds.
            The duodecimal (base 12) system is a pre-arabic system of counting,
            easy to do because you count finger joints on your hand with your thumb.
            The sexagesimal (base 60) system is convenient for expressing fractions.

          <aside class="notes">
            The system of dividing a day into seconds produced a variable length second,
            since days are variable length, and are slowly getting longer because
            the tidal effect of the moon transfers momentum from the earth to the moon,
            causing the earth to slow and the moon to speed up, and recede by 4 cm a year.
            Thus, the SI system uses a fixed length second.<br>
            1 SI second = the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.
            This corresponds to the estimated average length of a real second in 1820, a year for which they had good estimates.
            The only truly accurate clocks are therefore the cesium-133-based atomic clocks.

          <aside class="notes">
            However, since the length of a second is fixed, and the day is slowly growing longer,
            this means that the SI day is a bit too short. For this reason,
            the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)
            decides about 6 months in advance when to add a leap second,
            which adds one second to the latest minute of the day,
            creating a 61 second minute.<br>
            The result of adding leap seconds to TAI is UTC, coordinated universal time.
            The british wanted CUT, the french wanted TUC, and UTC is the compromise
            (actual reason for why that is the acronym). The leap second is added at midnight UTC,
            so it falls in different times in different time zones.<br>
            Gotcha: it's not possible to predict time to the second more than a year in advance,
            because it is not known exactly when leap seconds will be needed.<br>
            UTC is currently TAI + 37 seconds.

            A time zone identifier (e.g. "Europe/Brussels") determines a function or calculation rule.
            This function takes a time in UTC and outputs a time in the local time for that time zone.
            More accurately, it calculates the offset between UTC and local time at that instant in time,
            which can then be added to UTC to get the local time. The process is not reversible, 
            you cannot derive UTC from local time without knowing the offset (the result of the prior calculation).<br>
            Regions not near the tropics tend to observe DST because it produces longer evenings.

            This will cause software to think it is 1901.
            Much software today still bakes in 32-bit time_t values, like the Ext3 filesystem, or the MySQL database.
            There is <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/y2038/vfs">on-going work in the linux kernel</a> to fix this issue.
            The mac FHS+ filesystem has a date representation that rolls over in 2040,
            which is one of the reasons Apple FS is replacing it in new OS updates.<br>
            The C time_t is not a particularly bad time representation, but it has a limited range,
            limited precision (whole seconds), and it does not handle time zones.

            The Real Time Clock is kept in hardware, battery-backed,

            If the delta is > 128 ms it sets the local clock, otherwise it <em>slews</em> it, speeding it up or down, by 0.5 ms per second.
            The consequence is that you can't really know whether delta's you obtain from the clock are in any way reliable.<br>
            Essentially the only reliable time source is an atomic clock. GPS satellites carry multiple rubidium atomic clocks.
            If you use a GPS receiver you can get the time accurate to ~100 ns.<br>

            NTP allows you to get an accuracy of ~150 ms in practice. Google wanted to do better, so they use <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/nl//pubs/archive/45855.pdf">TrueTime</a> to get an accuracy of 7 ms.

            While it has even greater range than MySQL's datetime type (4713 BC to 294276 AD),
            with microsecond precision, it has an odd behavior of the timestamp with time zone type.
            Timestamp without time zone always interprets input strings in session time,
            stores in UTC, and outputs back in session time. Timestamp with time zone
            adds the twist of interpreting tz identifiers in input strings to allow inputting time
            in a different time zone than the session time zone.

            Oracle supports a very wide range of dates, and the timestamp types support fractional seconds as well.
            Timestamp stores local date and time and does not adjust it.
            Timestamp with local time zone converts session TZ to UTC and vice versa, 
            so it is very convenient for dealing with moments in time that you want
            to represent in the time zone of the current user (= session time zone).
            Timestamp with time zone stores the offset along with the UTC time, so both
            local time when the time was inserted and UTC time are known, which covers all needs.
            Finally the date field stores local date and time. There is no support for the ANSI SQL TIME type,
            but that's mostly ok because the DATE field can be used and its date component ignored.
            Surprisingly, despite not implementing the standard properly, Oracle covers all needs pretty efficiently.

            It turns out that some people only have a birth year, not a birth date.
            You find this in Asia and Central Africa, and you do run across this in practice.
            Storing birth dates is therefore notoriously tricky, and best not done with a date type.

            Where possible always work in coordinated time,
            either UTC or zoned time convertible to UTC.
            If you need to keep wall clock time, then use local time + an offset to store it,
            so that it remains convertible to UTC.<br>
            Try to use only one source of time, to avoid synchronization issues
            between the different time sources (e.g. trying to edit a future item).<br>
            Try to centralize your time handling code in a way that is easy to test,
            generally it is best to put time manipulation and calculation code in separate
            classes or functions, to keep that pure (not mixed with side effects or other concerns),
            and to use immutable date/time values.<br>
            Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date/time format</a> instead of the unix timestamp.
            It can store time with a higher range, and can store both UTC
            and zoned time keeping track of the offset relative to UTC.<br>
            Don't worry too much about edge cases like leap seconds and DST.
            In practice it doesn't matter whether you support them correctly.

          <aside class="notes">
            By default always use the TIMESTAMP type, since it stores as UTC
            but displays as local time, which is usually what you want.<br>
            When you have a need to store actual local time,
            use a format that is convertible to ISO 8601 (has an offset),
            TS w/ TZ when it is available (TS w/ LOCAL TZ in oracle), 
            and VARCHAR otherwise (storing an ISO timestamp).<br>
            Use the database as your time source, and use the SQL92 CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() function
            to do so. It is available in all databases and returns a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
            for databases that support that type. It is also replication-safe, so it will
            give consistent time in clustered databases.<br>
            All of this magic only works if you set the DB session time zone when you create
            the database connection.

          <aside class="notes">
            You want to use the DateTime class instead of the legacy date functions,
            and preferably the DateTimeImmutable class to avoid having values modified
            that you didn't expect to be modified.<br>
            It is always best to have a single source of time, and the database is the best candidate.
            Therefore, it is a good idea to always obtain "now" from the database
            using the <code>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()</code> SQL function.<br>
            Finally, it is best practice to set your default PHP timezone (for new DateTime values)
            on every request. The best approach for multi time zone software is storing the time zone
            in the user's profile (where they can change it), and then using that as the PHP time zone,
            setting it on every request, and as the DB session time zone, setting it on every connection.

          <h2>JavaScript strategies</h2>

            <li class="fragment"><em>Avoid</em> when possible</li>
            <li class="fragment"><code>moment-timezone</code> instead of <code>Date</code></li>

            <li class="fragment"><code>window.performance.now()</code> for profiling</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            When possible, avoid doing date arithmetic in JavaScript. Date is a terrible API,
            and it has no alternative (everything else wraps it). If you must do so,
            then use the momentjs library with the <a href="https://momentjs.com/timezone/">moment-timezone</a> extension.<br>
            Obtain the current time from the server (ultimately the database) to ensure consistent time
            across clients, since you never know whether a client's clock is correct.<br>
            Finally use the window.performance.now() api when measuring elapsed time for profiling purposes,
            since it has microsecond resolution and is guaranteed to be linearly increasing at a rate of one second per second.
            PHP has no alternative for window.performance.now(), so you're stuck with querying the clock via DateTime,
            which can behave unpredictably.

            <li class="fragment">Test the future <em>in the past</em></li>
            <li class="fragment">Use <em>interesting</em> dates</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            You want to cover your date/time handling code with tests,
            but you don't want those tests to be brittle. Having a random element like <em>now</em>
            in those tests can cause brittle behavior, so it is best to design the code
            so that you can inject a different value of <em>now</em> for test purposes.<br>
            Then, with that ability, you can put now at some point in the past,
            so that you can write tests that deal with past, present and future entirely in the past.
            The advantage is that calendar rules never change in the past,
            so you can reliably bake the desired behavior into your tests.<br>
            Finally, try to not just test the golden path, but test interesting boundary conditions,
            like around the new year, or on a leap day. Don't sweat the small stuff like leap seconds
            and DST, they rarely lead to significant bugs anyway.
